Require things+knowledge of:-
1. MTK Device's boot.img and custom recovery.img (CWM/TWRP/etc)
2. Windows PC with Cygwin and MT65xx .img unpack/repack scripts
3. Notepad++
4. A Class 6 or better Micro SD Card+a good card reader (lower than class 6 will give you lags/phone freeze, but, it'll work)
5. Mini tool partition wizard
6. Working roms for your device
7. A compression tool (i use 7zip)
8. Mobile uncle tool (google play, apk) installed in phone (or sp flash tool in pc, if you want it this way )


Steps:-

1. PARTITIONING MEMORY CARD:
Plug your memory card using card reader and copy everything from it to PC as we are going to partition it.
All partitions are PRIMARY

Select your card in mini tool and delete the partition. Partition it as follows-

First Partition-FAT32 (total memory card size-1924mb) <----- SD CARD
This is the space you will see as your memory card (external sd) in both of your roms.

Second Partition-EXT4 (550mb) <------ SYSTEM
This is System Partition of Second Rom

Third Partition-EXT4 (1024mb) <----- DATA
This is Data Partition of Second Rom, apps will go here

Fourth Partition-EXT4 (350mb) <----- CACHE
You can reduce it a bit more if you want to.



2. PREPARING SECONDARY ROM'S ZIP:
Get the updater-script of the rom you want to dual boot and open it up in notepad++
Press ctrl+F in notepad++ and go to replace tab.

Find what-mmcblk0p3 (may differ for different devices, look for "mount("ext4", "EMMC", "/dev/block/mmcblk0p3");" in updater script to know)
Replace with-mmcblk1p2

Save it and move it back to its location in zip (META-INF\com\google\android)
Note: if there is data folder in rom's zip then you also have to replace data partition block with mmcblk1p3, like: mmcblk0p5--->mmcblk1p3



3. PREPARING SECONDARY ROM'S BOOT.IMG:[/COLOR]
Unpack boot.img of the rom you want to dual boot using mt65xx tool and cygwin.
Open notepad++ and drag and drop all files of ram-disk to notepad++
Once again, find and replace:

Find what-emmc@android
Replace with-mmcblk1p2

Find what-emmc@usrdata
Replace with-mmcblk1p3

Find what-emmc@cache
Replace with-mmcblk1p4

Save all and pack the ram-disk with kernel to dualboot.img



4. PREPARING SECONDARY ROM'S RECOVERY (OPTIONAL IF YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE SECONDARY ROM EVER):[/COLOR]
Unpack recovery.img like your unpacked boot.img and open 'etc\recovery.fstab' with notepad++

Edit from this-
Code:
# mount point	fstype		device			[device2]

/boot		emmc		/dev/bootimg
/cache		ext4		/emmc@cache
/data		ext4		/emmc@usrdata
/misc		emmc		/dev/misc
/recovery	emmc		/dev/recovery
/emmc		vfat		/emmc@fat
/system		ext4		/emmc@android
/sdcard		vfat		/dev/block/mmcblk1p1	/dev/block/mmcblk1
/sd-ext         auto            /dev/block/mmcblk1p2
to this
Code:
# mount point	fstype		device			[device2]

/boot		emmc		/dev/bootimg
/cache		ext4		/dev/block/mmcblk1p4
/data		ext4		/dev/block/mmcblk1p3
/misc		emmc		/dev/misc
/recovery	emmc		/dev/recovery
/emmc		vfat		/emmc@fat
/system	        ext4		/dev/block/mmcblk1p2
/sdcard		vfat		/dev/block/mmcblk1p1	/dev/block/mmcblk1
#/sd-ext        auto            /dev/block/mmcblk1p5
Save and pack the edited one as dualrecovery.img.



5. MAKING UPDATE.ZIP FOR BOOT.IMG:
Download Boot.zip, copy it once, open Boot.zip with 7zip and place your Primary Rom's boot.img (replace the dummy one) in it with meta-inf folder.
Rename the Copy of Boot.zip to DualBoot.zip and place Secondary Rom's boot.img (the one you edited in step 3) in it with meta-inf folder.



6. SETTING UP IN MEMORY CARD:
a. Move all initially copied files back to your card
b. Create 2 folders with names:
"1Primary Rom"
"1Secondary Rom"

In "1Primary Rom" copy/move-
a. Boot.zip
c. Primary Rom.zip (not required)

In "1Secondary Rom" copy/move-
a. DualBoot.zip
b. Secondary Rom.zip



7. FLASHING/SWITCHING ROMS:
Just reboot to recovery and flash the Secondary rom from "1Secondary Rom' folder and after that flash "DualBoot.zip"
You will be rebooted to secondary rom automatically.

To Switch Roms, Reboot to recovery and flash Boot.zip for primary and DualBoot.zip for secondary rom.



8. SYNC DATA OF APPS BETWEEN ROMS:
Like in my case, if you want to test/use both rom at the same time or want to use features of both roms at the same time, consider making a filter in primary rom's titanium backup, of user apps which are common in both the roms, and export the list to clipboard.

Create a widget of ti backup up to 'backup all modified data' and use the filter you just created.
Open any file explorer (i use es file explorer) and create a new text file and past the list of apps (you exported to clipboard in ti backup), save it.
Reboot to secondary rom, open that text file, copy everything, open ti backup, create filter, import from clipboard, save and create a widget same way.
Restore date of this filter in secondary rom.

Whenever you want to switch rom, tap the widget, reboot to secondary/primary rom, restore filter.

For contacts, calender, browser bookmarks, etc, use google account to sync in both roms.


Notes:
1. By this folder preparation in memory card, you will get these two folders at the top in cwm recovery, this is for ease only.
2. If you want to use data on sd kind of thing, use mmcblk1p5 instead of mmcblk1p2 (not tested if data on sd will work or not with secondary rom)
3. If you want to apply any update to secondary rom, check the updater-script of the update if there is a need to edit mount path (mmcblk0p3-->mmcblk1p2)
4. Recovery for secondary rom should be flashed using mobile uncle tools/sp flash tool before flashing secondary rom, second time. As this time we will need to wipe data, cache, dalvik-cache and system if required.
